Implementing Gradient Descent for Linear Regression.
I used two methods closed form solution and gradient descent to perform linear regression on sample data created from y = 3 + 4x with some noise. The closed form method finds the best line directly, while gradient descent learns it step by step. Both methods produced very similar results, showing that gradient descent worked correctly.
